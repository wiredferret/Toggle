Before the route can support this level of traffic, Spacelanes needs to build some more infrastructure.

To reduce the congestion, Telzey dials back the markers so that they only appear to every other ship. The route can handle half the traffic while Spacelanes gets the support systems in place for full traffic.

Because of the new-style markers, they only have to mark a planet once, and then multiple routes can use it, instead of having to leave multiple almost-identical markers. The automated switching means that Toggle has less manual labor to do, and can spend more time on their mycology experiments.

Accessibility can include colors, but it can also mean offering users interfaces designed for tabbed or touch interfaces, interfaces that don&#39;t download images for slow connections, or even interfaces that are automatically dimmed at night.

The Net doesn&#39;t always have a lot of bandwidth between the stars, so Toggle appreciates it when she can set the tablet to only download images when they click them. It&#39;s fine to download everything planetside, but not out here.

In the same way, you may want to test a product internally before you show it to the outside world. Use a feature toggle to turn it on only for the people who are logged in from your company IP addresses.

Any spaceperson will tell you that you don&#39;t have to turn your rockets all the way on or all the way off to get where you&#39;re going. Steady, constant acceleration will do the trick and leave you more room for emergency manuevering.

When we launch a product, we can start by showing it just to the people who signed up as beta testers, or just to 10% of our user base. That gives us some time to make sure there aren&#39;t any unexpected effects at a larger scale, and that our infrastructure is up to the load. We can gradually increase the roll-out.

Not everyone is excited about the amazing new features you&#39;ve added. In fact, some people are really resistant to change, because they&#39;ve built a whole infrastructure around the way it used to be.

Rather than force them to upgrade, you can create a non-upgrading group, and leave them out of all the new stuff so they can keep doing their custom things.

Your feature may be banned in some countries. Or you may need to use a different method of data collection. What if you need to comply with COPPA, to track how children use your site?

Your deployment can have room for all these variables in the same codebase, if you take the time to design your features to be able to operate independently as they are switched on and off.

Think of your features like microservices - nothing is going to need to call all of them except a test harness.

If you&#39;ve ever had to have an extended negotiation with someone because you have a merge conflict, you know why it&#39;s best to do trunk development or very short-lived branches. Trunk development seems risky until you realize that you have total control over what is actually released.

Sometimes it&#39;s hard keep a bunch of branches straight in space-time. That&#39;s why Toggle wishes that everyone used the same spacelane, but Toggle doesn&#39;t always get their way.

But what if instead of rolling back, you could roll foward? Keep all the good parts of the deploy, and just turn off the one feature that is failing, rather than everything? That would be better.

Once Toggle has planted the markers, they can be changed from back in the home office without anyone being close to them, but Toggle needs to put them in place.

Toggle&#39;s spacelane markers look like this:

There isn&#39;t enough provisioning along this route for the amount of traffic trying to take it. Before the route can support this level of traffic, Spacelanes needs to build some more infrastructure.

Hey, folks! Let&#39;s choose our adventure. Each of these choices will lead you down a different deployment-style path.

The goal of this game is to let you explore some of the ways you can use feature flags, progressive deployment, and multivariate delivery to change how your deployments work.

You are a developer deploying your code to the trunk, but not always for external audiences. You don&#39;t intend to release it now, or you are not even in charge of releases.

Using feature flags for design is a way to give designers and product owners control over the user experience without having to go back to development with requests for every change. 

Design choices with feature flags could be either from the product side - things like A/B testing or experimentation, or it could be driven from the user-side - things like setting your accessibility preferences or colors.

Ops is full of people who care about things working. They care passionately and they spend a lot of time thinking about it, but that doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s always easy to keep things up and running - IT systems, like spaceships, are complex and have a lot of moving parts. Like spaceships, you need to fix small problems quickly before they become Very Large Problems.

Some of the ways to short-circuit problems are failovers and kill switches. Some of the ways to prevent them are progressive deployment and extensive testing.

There is an art and science to sales and marketing, and those teams often have very clear and compelling use cases for being able to control what features a user has or demonstrate what is possible. 

Sales teams might want to be able to customize currency. Marketing teams might want to target specific segments of the user base. Either team wants to be able to make sure that customers paying for premium features can get them easily and instantly. 

Here are some examples of settings that can be tweaked:

Whatever their goal, we want to make sure the users, and the travelers, get the experience they are hoping for. For the travelers, they expect to get where they&#39;re going with a minimum of space-turbulence, and they expect astronaut ice-cream if they bought the deluxe meal plan.

In software, we want to give users what they expect, or possibly a couple small, pleasant surprises. Large changes that they can&#39;t control are just annoying.

What can you put under user control, instead of assuming that everyone wants the same design?

When Toggle plants a flag, nothing much happens right away. They report the code back to headquarters, and headquarters plots it on a map. Toggle goes on to the next exploration zone.

When the new route is fully plotted and connected to the network, the headquarters team sends through some test shuttles to see how well the route works and how fast it is. When they are satisfied it is safe and efficient, they send the spaceliners through. Toggle might be halfway across the quadrant by then. 

Deployment is not the same thing as activation/launch/release. You need to think of deployment and release as different things before feature flags will seem useful to you.

Here are some ways that feature flags can make your deployment process more granular once you have released your feature.

Different accessibility fixes sometimes conflict with each other. Increasing font size to help with low vision may be the wrong choice for a user whose primary concern is screen readers. Captchas may rely on vision and exclude users who need audio prompts. Allowing users to choose the accessibility features that they want is empowering and useful. 

We have learned from Universal Design that adaptations originally intended for people with disabilities are actually useful to a large number of people. People with normal hearing may use screen captions to watch movies without disturbing others. People looking at their phones may notice the tactile difference of textured curbs. People with strollers and wheeled suitcases may use ramps and curbcuts. The more accessibility customization we build in and allow, the better it is for everyone.

We are all only temporarily able-bodied.

Dogfood is for developers, but internal testing can be a larger group within your company. 

For example, what if you open testing a new feature to your training or support team so they can prepare for it before it rolls out to the public. They may catch workflow or technical problems that developers wouldn&#39;t notice.

Toggle isn&#39;t part of the Canteen Crew, but they do help out by testing space-stable rations. The persimmon flavor is really good!

A canary launch is a way to safety-test your release. You can choose a small percentage of users who will get the new feature, and closely monitor the analytics for their experience. Canary launches reduce the risk that you might roll out a bad change to your whole userbase.

Canary launches can also be used to get information about more than just your application reliability. You can use them to explore sentiment around interface changes or detect how much load a new feature will add to your needs.

You know that customer who is still using Internet Explorer 6, and won&#39;t leave it, and won&#39;t continue to buy your product if you stop supporting it? They are an albatross. They&#39;re big - they give you a lot of money, so you don&#39;t want to lose them as a client, but you also don&#39;t want to tell anyone else in the world that you&#39;re willing to support IE6. 

Use an albatross flag to continue support only for them while the rest of your users will not see that legacy support and ask for it themselves. Sometimes things have to last a long time without updates, when they&#39;re in space.

Your maketing department is full of people who can tell you an amazing number of things about your users, like how they are distributed by age, and what other products they are likely to buy. Depending on your size, marketing has likely already defined several *segments* of people who have different interests, ways of using your product, use cases, or other defining characteristics. You can work with marketing to make sure specific features are delivered to exactly the targeted demographic and no one else.

Something has gone very wrong with a feature, and you need to get it out of production fast!

You might be making bogus stock trades or spamming your cloud provider, or spinning up hundreds of thousands of VMs a minute, but whatever it is, time is of the essence.

Since you wrapped the feature in a flag, all you have to do is turn the flag off. If your flag management system is push-based, the change will happen very rapidly, almost instantly. If the system is based on polling, it will turn off as soon as a request can be returned. Either way, it will probably be much faster than finding a build that doesn&#39;t have the problem and deploying it to everyone.

Test in production, but not where anyone can see.

The goal is to have the ability to test your new feature against all the things that are unique about production, such as weird user accounts, message volume, scale, speed, latency, and other factors. The other goal is to never have a user complain because our testing broke their experience.

Visibility is being able to control exactly who sees the feature. That might be just yourself, or your team, or anyone in your company. It might include a small number of customers or test users. It&#39;s up to you, and being able to make these choices gives you more power.

One of the most stressful parts of developing in a team is making sure that your code fits in with other people&#39;s work without anyone causing problems for each other. This is especially difficult when everyone is working in individual development branches that aren&#39;t visible.

The act of moving code into a shared context and reconciling it is called merging. Merging is much less of an issue if everyone has their code in the same location because they are doing trunk-based development. Use feature flags to keep unfinished code from being revealed to users while your teammates can still see it.

&lt;img src=&quot;https://wiredferret.github.io/Toggle/img/currency.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;Stack of currency from different countries&quot;&gt;

Currency is a an interesting problem when you are a global sales organization. You want to accurately report the price of something, but you have a lot of complications. Not only are there currencies with different symbols, there are also currencies that have the same symbol and name, but different monetary values. For example, a $(USD), a $(CAD), and $(DOP) are all different currencies with different values. How do you ensure your customers are seeing the right price?

One way to do this is to detect where your user is, based on information they provide or browser or IP settings. Use flags to keep your underlying code consistent while making sure you give everyone the currency that is appropriate to their country.

How do you want to get paid? Toggle gets paid in bars of gold-pressed latinum, but you may want to switch your prices from US dollars to Canadian dolllars, or yen or pesos or euros.

Sometimes we want our users to have different experiences, depending on what they paid for. If a customer has chosen a premium experience and paid to avoid ads and see extra features, you can put that experience in a flag and continue to have a consistent code base that serves all your types of customers.

You can also use flags to control the access to a trial or beta feature for customers who are still deciding to purchase.

Super-luxury spaceliners are fast and comfortable, but they cost a lot to fly on. Toggle knows that if you&#39;re willing to fly in a smaller cabin, you can save a lot of gold-pressed latinum. It&#39;s the same spaceliner, but different experiences.

It&#39;s valuable to offer users who are new to an application or feature a tutorial that gives them hints and instructions about how to use it. However, that same helpfulness can be annoying for experienced users. 

Users should be able to turn off helpful tools when they are done with them, and one way to offer that capability is to expose a flag control for the tutorial to the user.

Have you tested it? Because if you haven&#39;t, it&#39;s not a backup, it&#39;s a security blanket, and about as useful in case something goes wrong.

When something goes wrong in your infrastructure and deployment setup, you want to be able to redirect traffic automatically, since people are the slow, meat-based part of any operations system. Using feature flags, APIs, and monitoring, you can set up your system to change to a different feature set, different hardware set, or different configuration without needing to redeploy any software.

In systems with large bundled deployments, a failure in any feature may mean that the whole deployment must be rolled back.

White-labelling is putting customer branding on something that was created to be resold. For example, Shopify makes shopping carts for many different retailers, but those retailers can change the way the cart looks and feels to match with the rest of their site. For some software companies, they provide the branding changes as part of the service to their customers.

The problem with white-labeling is that it is easy to end up with a branch for each client, but then it is difficult to update each branch accurately with identical changes as the underlying platform changes. Feature flags solve this problem by making the cosmetic changes a flag for each client, and the core code stays unified and easy to update.

What people want, when they want it.

It&#39;s frustrating to page past or search through documentation that covers features you don&#39;t have or platforms you&#39;re not using. One of the things you can use targeted delivery for is tuning your documentation to reflect the parts of the product the customer has, and only giving them what they need.

Flagging documentation and tutorials and interfaces to reflect the package the user has is a way to make them feel like they are getting the correct experience.

This is the green field scenario, where you&#39;re creating fresh code from scratch and everything is new and shiny. It&#39;s really easy to start using feature flags in this case, because all you have to do is create a feature flag, and then fill in the feature as you go along, and nothing will change until you turn it on.

But you still have to decide which development method you&#39;ll be using. Are you going to create a feature branch, or will you put all your code in trunk as you&#39;re writing it?

Nothing is new between the suns. Most of us don&#39;t get to start with an entirely fresh environment to do whatever we want with. Instead, we&#39;re going to have to work with an existing code base and figure out how to convert it.

Toggle is looking into moving through settled space and working to understand how best to do their work.

There are three main proposals. Which do you vote for?

[[Slow and steady]]
[[Only new features]]
[[Rip off the bandaid]]

As the spacelanes are explored, each one is marked with a proprietary labeling system unique to the company that set them up. Sometimes the companies want to combine their businesses or routes, and then someone has to make sure that the different route markers all work together to get passengers where they&#39;re going. The best way to do that is to look at a big map overview and see if everything matches or if people need to make some choices about what has to get dropped.

The new CTO at Spacelanes, Inc. is committed to Continuous Deployment and Integration. They want to be able to deploy dozens of times a day and turn features on and off when they&#39;re ready. 

The only way to do this is to make it so that planets aren&#39;t online until everything is ready, even if they have been explored and marked. Once the full path has been checked for hazards, then you can turn on the markers that send people that way.

Since you don&#39;t know how it&#39;s going to go, which planet would you like to try first?

Well, it&#39;s not often that a space traveller ends up in this mess, because space is pretty big, but two objects can&#39;t occupy the same space at the same time. 

If Toggle and another scout put down beacon flags on the same bit of space rock, then the home office has to talk to the other corporation and either disable one of the flags or do some fancy work to offset the timing of the beacons. It&#39;s kind of a headache and no one likes it. 

Toggle thinks this would all go better if people could just use the same flags for every spaceliner company.

Something has gone super wrong. The spaceliner keeps seeing the flag on the other side of the Planet Cherry and going around and around in an orbit instead of on to the next flag. One of these flags is obviously wrong and needs to be turned off, but which one, and when? We can&#39;t leave these people pointed the wrong direction.

Welp. Toggle though they had a good idea on how to get through this asteroid field, and then it turns out they were wrong and this is a dead end. Toggle is going to have to backtrack and pick up that last flag marker, but at least it&#39;s not a big deal.

Too much! Let&#39;s slow that down.

Some of the spacelane routes are going to be super popular when they open, but if everyone starts out down the same path from Earth the minute they open, there will be a traffic jam. 

Instead, SpaceLanes is going to meter the traffic so that there is room for everyone. Some people will start a little later, but everyone will get where they are going without overwhelming the system.

Conversion is slow, but it will get us there eventually. Instead of doing a big surge or only flagging new features, features are converted as they are touched or opened. 

The spaceliner doesn&#39;t actively convert markers from one type to another, but if a marker needs repair, it is replaced with the upgraded version.

Only new features get flags. There&#39;s no business case for going back and changing the way existing features are managed.

The old system is working fine and doesn&#39;t need to be changed where it already exists. Instead, every time a new planet is discovered, it is fitted out with the new signal system. As time goes on and older planets become less relevant, it doesn&#39;t matter that they still have old systems.

This is gonna hurt, but only for a bit.

Sometimes the best way to handle updating a code base in to dedicate time to it and all work together to make it happen. It stops your progress on anything else, but it can be very fast and efficient since the same tasks are repeated over and over. 

The spaceline needs to change over the way they direct ships around, and all of the existing methods on established planets are outdated. For one astral month, they dedicate all their resources to replacing old signals instead of exploring and planting new ones. At the end of that time, the core systems are all updated.

Teaching people to change the way they work requires everyone to make a conscious effort, and it means that people who used to be really fast at their job are a bit slower. It&#39;s hard, and people resist it. But even if it&#39;s difficult, we can get through all sorts of things as a team, and we&#39;ll get through this change in scout ships together. 

Toggle is a little dubious - they love their scout ship, but they agree that something that seems slow and difficult now will probably get easier as they get used to it.

To celebrate the opening of 500 new spacelanes, Spacelanes, Inc. has called in all the scouts like Toggle, and invited all the ship technicians and spaceliner crews, and office staff to the Best Space Cantina Ever.

You would not believe Toggle&#39;s zero-G dance moves. They have had a lot of time to practice.

A/B testing is traditionally a way to test out how audiences react to a small interface change by delivering the variant to half the users. Many organizations do this with full statistical significance and rigor, but others use it to confirm or deny theories about interface preferences without an experimental framework.

Many A/B tests are run with load balancers or other methods, but using a feature flag to control who sees a variation allows you to do tests quickly and without needing active development involvement. You can also do tests that have more than one variation - A/B/C/D/etc tests. There&#39;s no One True Way to use feature flags, just ways that we are all trying out.

If you know who someone is because they have logged into your site, you have the opportunity to give them a custom experience with all the flags set the way they want them. You can add greetings and customization, make sure they have access to everything they pay for, and keep their experience seamless.

It&#39;s important to use this customization in accordance with your privacy policies, but if you have an existing relationship, make your space a comfortable place for people you already know.

There&#39;s nothing like hooking into a docking bay that already has the right atmosphere and gravity conditions to make it easier to concentrate on repairs, Toggle thinks.

We are all trying to be DevSecOps, right? Let&#39;s talk about how flags can help with security.

If you&#39;re using environment variables, it may be difficult to trace and report any changes in an auditor-friendly fashion. When was the change made, who made it, and what did it do?

You may also want to be able to control who has access to which flags. After all, it may not be a good idea to give the operations team the ability to turn off a long-running marketing test by accident, or allow just anyone to flip a feature kill switch.

Here are some options for flag settings that can help you make your compliance team happier.

[[Private attributes]]
[[Auditing]]
[[RBAC]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="49" name="Private attributes" tags="Security" position="1653,893" size="100,100">##Private attributes

When you set an attribute as private, all of the values in the attribute will stay on your side, and you won&#39;t be sending anything &quot;across the wire&quot;. Instead, the targeting rules will evaluate the value at the endpoint.

Toggle uses this setting when they run across a planet that would rather stay off the spaceline path. They do leave a flag, but the spaceliners won&#39;t stop there.

Developers use this setting to ensure that protected data doesn&#39;t leave their secure environment.

You don&#39;t want to be solving a mystery with no clues. And you don&#39;t want to face an auditor like this:
 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
 
Auditing means that all the changes you make to flag targeting or flag state are stored on our servers and available for review at any time. For example, an audit entry may include the time and date the flag was changed, the person who changed it, and what the final state is.

Secure audit logs are especially important for organizations who need to be able to prove that only authorized administrators can change the user experience.

Who gets to change settings? Who gets to see everything? Use roles to sort people, instead of manually adding them.

Role-based access control means that an administrator&#39;s ability to change the code is derived from the same place as their permissions to control other parts of your infrastructure. Setting a new administrator&#39;s security and privileges is as simple as adding them to a group with designated roles.

For Toggle, this means that all scouts can access any other scout&#39;s ship, in case of emergencies, but Toggle doesn&#39;t have the access to turn on the signal flags - only SpaceLanes HQ can do that.

* Do I want this forever or just for now?
* Does this do one and only one thing?
* What is the failsafe position?
* What&#39;s the point?

Feature flags can encourage good programming practices by encouraging us to think through the purpose and function of the thing we are building. These questions help us consider our purpose. 

Is this flag just for a temporary use, to add something to the deployment safely, or is it a control handle for a feature that may be used in the future? Am I mixing up more than one behavior in this feature, and is that a good choice? What should happen if the flag isn&#39;t on?

* What was the plan?
* Can I nuke this from orbit?
* What were you thinking?

One of the hardest parts of a shared development code base is figuring out what your teammates were trying to do. Theoretically they signalled their intent with comments, but that&#39;s not always true.

Feature flags can contain a lot of information about intent and purpose, both in their name and in the if/then statement that describes the targeting.

[[Back to Adventure choices|Adventure choices]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="55" name="Localization" tags="User" position="2335,892" size="100,100">##Localization

Localization is more than translation, it is making your app behave in a way that makes everyone feel comfortable, no matter what their language or country. Some features flags for localization might include right-to-left text, language, [[currency|Currency]], regional jokes, even interface [[color|User colors]]. 

Using flags could allow you to pull in information from translation files to present in the interface without needing to include and deploy the files. That gives your translation teams more time to work.

Toggle uses this kind of setting all the time, since different regions of space have different conditions. Sometimes it&#39;s faster to be able to pay for Space Slurpees in the local currency, rather than the exchange from universal.

It has been said that the best code diff is a red diff -- deleting code, features, and other old unused parts of your codebase is an essential part of making it readable, usable, secure, and stable.

But sometimes it&#39;s nervewracking to delete something that *may* still be needed. One way to handle this uncertainty is to flag the section that you are thinking of removing. This works like commenting it out, but you can also use it in a more nuanced way, for example turning a feature down gradually, or eliminating it from only certain segments of users.
